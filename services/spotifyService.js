 * Spotify Service
 * 
 * This service handles all interactions with the Spotify API for VinylVault application.
 * The Spotify API provides comprehensive music data including albums, artists, tracks, and audio features.
 * 
 * Primary Functions This Service Will Accomplish:
 * 
 * 1. ALBUM SEARCH & DISCOVERY
 *    - Search for albums by artist, album title, or track name
 *    - Retrieve detailed album information including release dates and genres
 *    - Get high-quality album artwork and cover images
 *    - Access complete track listings with durations and preview URLs
 * 
 * 2. ARTIST INFORMATION ENRICHMENT
 *    - Retrieve comprehensive artist profiles and biographies
 *    - Access complete discographies including all albums and singles
 * 
 * 3. TRACK & AUDIO FEATURES
 *    - Get detailed track information including ISRC codes (International Standard Recording Codes)
 *    - Retrieve track popularity and explicit content flags
 *    - Get 30-second preview URLs for track sampling
 *    - Access track markets and availability information
 * 
 * 4. MUSIC DISCOVERY & RECOMMENDATIONS
 *    - Generate personalized recommendations based on user's vinyl collection
 *    - Discover similar artists and albums to existing collection items
 * 
 * 5. VINYL COLLECTION ENHANCEMENT
 *    - Cross-reference vinyl records with Spotify catalog
 *    - Auto-populate missing album details from Spotify metadata
 *    - Validate artist and album names against Spotify's standardized data
 * 
 * 6. PLAYLIST INTEGRATION (NOT NEEDED BUT COULD BE A GOOD ADDITION IN THE FUTURE)
 *    - Create Spotify playlists from user's vinyl collection
 *    - Generate "Now Playing" playlists for specific vinyl records
 *    - Export vinyl collection as shareable Spotify playlists
 *    - Import Spotify liked songs to suggest vinyl purchases
 *    - Create genre-based playlists from collection categorization
 * 
 * 7. SOCIAL & SHARING FEATURES (NOT NEEDED BUT COULD BE A GOOD ADDITION IN THE FUTURE, THERE IS ALREADY A COMMUNITY FEATURE THAT SHOWS USERS' VINYL COLLECTIONS, THOUGH THIS ONLY SHOWS HOW MANY VINYL RECORDS THEY HAVE, NOT THE ACTUAL RECORDS)
 *    - Share vinyl records with embedded Spotify players
 *    - Generate social media friendly album previews
 *    - Create shareable collection highlights with audio samples
 *    - Enable users to follow friends' vinyl collections via Spotify integration
 *    - Implement vinyl wishlist sharing with Spotify preview links
 * 
 * 8. API RESPONSE HANDLING & OPTIMIZATION
 *    - Format Spotify API responses for VinylVault frontend consumption
 *    - Handle API rate limiting and OAuth token management
 *    - Cache frequently requested data to improve performance
 *    - Transform Spotify data structure to match VinylVault data models
 *    - Implement retry logic for failed API requests
 *
 * 9. SEARCH OPTIMIZATION & FILTERING
 *     - Implement intelligent search with fuzzy matching (APPROXIMATE STRING MATCHING)
 *     - Handle various search filters (year, genre, artist, album type)
 *     - Provide search suggestions and auto-complete functionality
 *     - Support advanced search queries with multiple parameters
 *     - Filter results by market availability and content type
 * 
 * Technical Implementation Notes:
 * - Will use Spotify Web API with proper OAuth 2.0 authentication (0Auth2.0 IS REQUIRED TO ALLOW ONE APP TO ACCESS ANOTHER APP'S DATA)
 * - Requires Spotify app credentials (Client ID and Client Secret)
 * - Implements token refresh mechanism for long-lived sessions
 * - Includes comprehensive error handling for API limitations
 * - Supports both public and user-specific data access
 * - Handles pagination for large result sets and user libraries (PAGINATION IS REQUIRED TO HANDLE LARGE DATA SETS, AND DIVIDE UP THE DATA INTO SMALLER, MORE MANAGEABLE CHUNKS)
